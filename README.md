Lung Cancer Prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict lung cancer using a dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

Features
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data trends and relationships.
Model Training: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for prediction.
Model Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate performance.
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or above
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Results
Summarize the key results, such as the model's performance metrics, and include any important observations from the analysis.
